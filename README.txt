This project is a randomized binary search tree.
It inserts nodes to create the shape of a tree that is created with keys that are inserted in random order.
This increases the probability that the tree will be more balanced.

The code is in the RandomBSTSymbolTable.java.
Run the test code through the RandomBSTSymbolTableTest.java.
